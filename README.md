üåç Vision Transformers for Satellite Imagery-Based Disaster Response

This project leverages **Vision Transformers (ViTs)** for analyzing satellite imagery to support **disaster response efforts**. The goal is to improve the accuracy and speed of damage assessment and environmental monitoring during and after natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, wildfires, and hurricanes.

## üìå Project Overview

In times of crisis, timely and accurate assessment of affected areas is critical. Satellite imagery offers large-scale views, but analyzing it effectively requires powerful models. Vision Transformers, originally developed for NLP tasks and adapted for vision, offer strong performance on high-resolution image classification and segmentation tasks.

This project:
- Trains and fine-tunes ViTs on satellite datasets
- Classifies damage levels and maps affected regions
- Provides tools for visualization and evaluation

## üß† Model Architecture

- **Backbone**: Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16 or Swin Transformer)
- **Tasks**: 
  - Image Classification (Damage/No Damage)
  - Semantic Segmentation (e.g., flooded vs. non-flooded regions)
- **Loss Functions**: CrossEntropy, Dice Loss
- **Optimization**: AdamW with learning rate scheduler
